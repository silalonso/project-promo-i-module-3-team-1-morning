## COMPUESTAS Y REACTIVAS

We chose that name because it's a good mix between "**Components**" and "**React**".

![Compuestas y Reactivas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silalonso/project-promo-i-module-3-team-1-morning/master/_src/assets/images/Team.jpg "The most Compound and Reactive women!")


## Purpose of the project

- The principal purpose of this project was dealing with legacy code and refactoring it.<br />
This way we developed our ability to adapt to existing projects. 
- Know how to identify and generate the components of a page, separate them, and create visually similar components from them.
- Learning how to use React to create simple web applications.
- Improve our ability to modify code created by other people, and become aware of the importance of creating good, clean code.
- Improve communication among team members.
- Improve public communication skills by exposing the project in the final session.

##  How we did it
- We **studied** the existent code.
- We **identified** and separated the components.
- We took those components and **adapted** them to React.js.
- We **implemented** the existing **functions** of the app.
- We did code **refactoring**.


##  Challenges we faced
- To understand code that wasn't wrote by us.
- Some of the functionalities were incomplete.
- Using a new programming language.
- Remote working during the entire process.


##  What we've learned
We have learned so many things making this project!  
Here are some of them:
- The importance o writting **clean code**. It's important for your future self, and for others, so they can understand what does every function and variable.
- Usefulines and importance of React components.
- React functionalities: Props, lifting, hooks, state, router.
- Code refactoring makes your programmer life easier!
- Communication is the key when working as a team.
- Every day is a new adventure, and you learn something interesting.
